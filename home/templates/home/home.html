            Background
        </h3>
        <p>
            The son of two engineers, I knew from a young age engineering was a good career option based on my
            interests and strengths. I have found a great fit as a software developer/engineer while at Northeastern.
            The biggest reasons I enjoy what I do:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accessibility: </strong>  Whatever technology I would like to include in a project, it is likely free.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Skills Used: </strong> Software development requires a mix of problem solving and creativity.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Product Driven: </strong> The greatest metric of your work is the power you give to the end user.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
                Outside of my professional life, I like to stay active through soccer, swimming, running, and hiking.
                I also enjoy playing video games and listening to music.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Experience
        </h3>
        <p>
            I am currently employed at Rightpoint Consulting, working as Product Engineering Co-op. I am on the
            Android team of a mobile security project, primarily writing in Kotlin. I enjoy this role because it
            allows me to work on both front and back end components of the app, as well as see the code I'm writing
            directly reflected in the product. The biggest challenge I faced was joining the project six months after it had begun.
            It was my first time working with a codebase of that magnitude, and I felt a little lost for the first month or two.
            However, it was a valuable experience that taught me how to acclimate myself to a large piece of work I had not written.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also spend a significant portion of my time working on side projects. I recently published an app,
            NewsStreams, which was also written for the Android platform in Kotlin. NewsStreams aims to help users find
            news articles on topics they care about. Users can aggregate stories on certain topics into "Streams"; users
            can also specify how often they want to see certain topics in their feed, whether they want to see trending, relevant, or
            recent articles, and the maximum age of the article. For more on NewsStreams or my projects in general, check out
